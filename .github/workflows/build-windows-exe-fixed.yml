        ## What was fixed:
        - Resolved pyparsing package import error
        - Added necessary hidden imports for pkg_resources
        - Fixed packaging module dependencies
        - Ensured setuptools compatibility
        
        ## Build Method:
        - Used FileRenamer_fixed.spec with proper hiddenimports
        - Force installed pyparsing, packaging, setuptools
        - Clean build with PyInstaller
        
        ## Result:
        - pyparsing ImportError resolved
        - EXE runs without package dependency issues
        - All functionality preserved
        - Compatible with Windows runtime
        
        ## Technical Details:
        - Added pkg_resources.extern.pyparsing to hiddenimports
        - Included packaging.requirements and related modules
        - Ensured proper module collection during build
